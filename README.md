#Colored Pages
This is a super simple repo. It's not meant to do anything significant because it is used by another project to demonstrate how docker can be used in production.

## Branches
The only interesting thing about this project is that the index.html page is red when you're on the red branch and blue if you're on the blue branch etc, etc.
